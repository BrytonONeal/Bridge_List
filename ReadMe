All you need to include in your file is 
#include "BridgeList.h"

and you should be able to use
BridgeList<Datatype> test;
BridgeList<Datatype>* test = new BridgeList<Datatype>;

to create a bridgelist. Datatype can be replaced with any declared datatype. int, boolean, string, etc
additional institutions can be found in the code
